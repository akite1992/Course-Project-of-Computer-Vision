# Course-Project-of-Computer-Vision

This is codes for a course project in computer vision at MIT in 2015.

The purpose of the project is to train a convolutional neural network(CNN) to classify images for places.

The code uses an open-source package Maxconvnet.

Main codes include:

1.cnn_new_trian.m: Train CNN with SGD and 1 GPU

2.new_refNet_initial.m: Deisign the architecture for CNN

3.run_miniplacesCNN.m: Run CNN to make predictions
